## Bond Package 3-Point-Bending Tutorial

### Simulation Description

This tutorial simulates the 3-point-bending test of a fiber. A fiber with
diameter 2.83 mm and length of 55 mm, is placed on to cylindrical supports
under atoms 2 and 3, and atoms n-2 and n-1.

![3-Point-Bending Before Load](images/tutorial_bond_single_3PointBending_1.png "3-Point-Bending1")

The plunger plungs into the fiber at 4 mm/s until the plunger travels 2 mm.

Once the plunger reaches the max displacement, it then travels back to where
it began at 4 mm/s.
