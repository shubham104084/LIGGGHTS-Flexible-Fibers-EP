## Fix Air Drag Command

### Syntax

```text
fix ID group-ID airdrag fluid_viscocity fluid_density wx wy wz region
```

* ID, group-ID are documented in the [fix](fix) command
* airdrag = style name of this fix command
* fluid_viscocity = viscocity of fluid (Pa s)
* fluid_density = density of fluid (kg/m3)

*Optional* *Inputs*

* wx, wy, wz = fluid velocity in the x, y, and z directions (m/s)
* region = region name for the fix to interact with

### Examples

```text
fix 1 all airdrag 1.8e-5 1.23
fix 1 all airdrag 1.8e-5 1.23 0.0 0.0 1.0
fix 1 all airdrag 1.8e-5 1.23 0.0 0.0 1.0 vertChamber
```

### Description

Add a fluid to the simulation. The fluid interacts with the particles by the
following equations outlined by "Classical Mechanics" by John R. Taylor for
forces and "Viscous torque on a sphere under arbitrary rotation" by U. Lei er
al. for torque calculations.

#### Warning

The units for the coefficients are currently static and the user must make
sure that they are following what is laid out in this document. No options for
variable input are allowed at this time (v_wx). Currently to change flow
properties, one must unfix and then apply a new fix.

This fix is NOT a subsitute for a true CFD simulation.

### Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info

No information about this fix is written to
[binary restart files](restart). None of the [fix_modify](fix_modify)
options are relevant to this fix. No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various [output commands](dump). No
parameter of this fix can be used with the start/stop keywords of the
[run](run) command.

The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization, invoked
by the minimize command. This fix should only be used with damped dynamics
minimizers that allow for non-conservative forces. See the min_style command
for details.

### Restrictions

None

#### Defaults

wx = wy = wz = 0.0,
region = simulation domain
