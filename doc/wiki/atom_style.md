## Atom Style Command

### Syntax

```text
atom_style style args
```

* style = *bond* or *charge* or *hybrid* or *sphere* or *granular* or
*bond/gran* or *superquadric* or *sph*

```text
args = none for any style except hybrid and bond/gran
hybrid args = list of one or more sub-styles, each with their args
bond/gran args = n_bondtypes k and bonds_per_atom m and/or
    disableNormalContact n
    n_bondtypes k = number of bond types to be used in the simulation (k > 0)
    bonds_per_atom m = max number of bonds each atom can have in the
    simulation (m > 0)
    disableNormalContact n = disables the contact equations for a bonded pair
    of atoms if set to 1. (0 or 1)
```

### Examples

```text
* atom_style sphere

* atom_style superquadric

* atom_style hybrid sphere bond/gran n_bondtypes 1 bonds_per_atom 8 &
                           disableNormalContact 1
```

### Description

Define what style of atoms to use in a simulation. This determines what
attributes are associated with the atoms. This command must be used before a
simulation is setup via a [read_data](read_data),
[read_restart](read_restart), or [create_box](create_box) command.

Once a style is assigned, it cannot be changed, so use a style general enough
to encompass all attributes. E.g. with style bond, angular terms cannot be
used or added later to the model. It is OK to use a style more general than
needed, though it may be slightly inefficient.

The choice of style affects what quantities are stored by each atom, what
quantities are communicated between processors to enable forces to be
computed, and what quantities are listed in the data file read by the
read_data command.

These are the additional attributes of each style and the typical kinds of
physical systems they are used to model. All styles store coordinates,
velocities, atom IDs and types. See the [read_data](read_data),
[create_atoms](not_done_yet), and [set](not_done_yet) commands for info on how
to set these various quantities.

#### Warning

It is possible to add some attributes, such as a molecule ID, to atom styles
that do not have them via the [fix property/atom](not_done_yet) command. This
command also allows new custom attributes consisting of extra integer or
floating-point values to be added to atoms. See the
[fix property/atom](not_done_yet) doc page for examples of cases where this is
useful and details on how to initialize, access, and output the custom values.

---

All of the styles assign mass to particles on a per-type basis, using the
[mass](not_done_yet) command, except for *sphere* or *granular* styles. They
assign mass to individual particles on a per-particle basis.

For the *sphere* style, the particles are spheres and each stores a
per-particle diameter and mass. If the diameter > 0.0, the particle is a
finite-size sphere. If the diameter = 0.0, it is a point particle. This is
typically used for granular models. Instead of sphere, keyword granular can be
used.

For the *bond/gran* style, the number of granular bonds per atom is stored,
and the information associated to it: the type of each bond, the ID of the
bonded partner atom and the so-called bond history. The bond history is
similar to the contact history for granular interaction, it stores the
internal state of the bond. What exactly is stored in this internal state is
defined by the granular [bond style](bond_style) used. There are 2 parameters:
The number of bond types, and the maximum number of bonds that each atom can
have. For each bond type, the parameters have to be specified via the
[bond_coeff](bond_coeff) command. Note that [bond/gran](bond_gran) is an
experimental code which is may not be available in your release of LIGGGHTS.

Typically, simulations require only a single (non-hybrid) atom style. If some
atoms in the simulation do not have all the properties defined by a particular
style, use the simplest style that defines all the needed properties by any
atom. For example, if some atoms in a simulation are charged, but others are
not, use the charge style. If some atoms have bonds, but others do not, use
the bond style.

The only scenario where the hybrid style is needed is if there is no single
style which defines all needed properties of all atoms. For example, if you
want dipolar particles which will rotate due to torque, you would need to use
“atom_style hybrid sphere dipole”. When a hybrid style is used, atoms store
and communicate the union of all quantities implied by the individual styles.

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC can be extended with new atom styles as well as new body
styles; see [this section](not_done_yet).

### Restrictions

This command cannot be used after the simulation box is defined by a
[read_data](read_data) or [create_box](not_done_yet) command.

The superquadric style is not yet available in the PUBLIC version The
convexhull style is not yet available in the PUBLIC version.

The bond, molecular styles are part of the MOLECULAR package. The line and tri
styles are part of the ASPHERE package. They are only enabled if
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC was built with that package. See the
[Making LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC](how_to_install) section for more info.
